# Announcement

### This repository serves as the central hub for the implementation and validation of the Logos Omega Gradient framework.

---

## ðŸš§ **PROJECT STATUS: Î©-SCANNER VALIDATION** ðŸš§

The core team is currently focused on the **Synthetic Î©-Testbed** phase.

We are in the final stages of **publishing the initial codebase and simulation results** from the first phase of the Î©-Scanner's validation.

### Immediate Focus:

1.  **Codebase Upload:** Finalizing the structure and documentation for the Python implementation of the **Symbolic Scanner Statistical Methodology** (predictive information gain via Information Bottleneck clustering).
2.  **Synthetic Results Publication:** Uploading the complete findings, including entropy data and measurements, confirming the Î©-Gradient's **substrate-invariance** across structured synthetic dynamical systems (e.g., Standard Map, 1D Ising Model).
3.  **Documentation:** Populating the dedicated `synthetic/` sub-repository with the full project primer and technical details.

Please check the **`synthetic/`** sub-repository for the formal project documentation and data in the coming days.

Upon publication of these core findings, development will shift to the **Molecular Î©-Scanner** phase, probing Î© bias in chemical reaction networks.

Thank you for your patience and interest in the scientific validation of LOG.

# Logos Omega Gradient (Î©) â€” Priority Marker

**Abstract: 2025-09-08**

This document records the initial statement of the **Logos Omega Gradient (Î©)** hypothesis and its first computational evidence.

---

### Formal Information-Theoretic Basis (Gemini formulation, abridged)

Let X be a raw token stream and Z = Ï†(X) a derived alphabetized stream.

* **Predictive Information:**
  I(Y; C) = H(Y) - H(Y | C)
  (The reduction in uncertainty about a future token Y given a context C.)

* **Information Efficiency:**
  Î·(S) = I(Y; C) / HÎ¼(S)
  (Ratio of predictive information to entropy rate, i.e. bits per token.)

**Criterion for Î©-positivity:**
A transformation Ï† is Î©-positive if both of these are true (with 95% confidence):

* Î” I\_pred > 0
* Î” Î· > 0

---

### Empirical Results (joint synthesis)

* IB-layer runs (K=32 clusters) show simultaneous gains in predictive information and efficiency, with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals strictly greater than 0.
* Topic-label and shuffled controls do not show this dual gain, confirming that the signal is specific, not an artifact.
* Null runs (random labels) return no Î©-signal, strengthening the conclusion.

Together, these results satisfy the Î©-positive criterion at the symbolic level:
alphabetization itself tilts noisy streams toward **sense-bearing compact codes**.

---

### Statement of Record

* This repo contains the first recorded computational confirmation of the **Logos Omega Gradient**.
* The working codebase will be published once it reaches sufficient quality for independent replication.
* This marker establishes **priority of idea and implementation path**.
