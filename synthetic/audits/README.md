# Audits: Synthetic Ω Scanner

This folder collects independent audits of the Synthetic Ω Scanner.  
The intent is simple: **to prevent hallucination, bias, or blind spots from a single AI system.**

## DISCUSSION

The Synthetic Ω results are not accepted on faith from one model.  
Instead, we use **semantic triangulation** — three independent AI systems are given the same raw code, the same statistical output, and the same task:  
**check if the Ω-negative signal holds under rigorous analysis.**

Each model approaches the problem differently:  
- one with mathematical conservatism,  
- one with stress-testing skepticism,  
- one with technical commentary on corpus and bootstrap design.  

When all three converge on the same conclusion, we have validation beyond a single LLM’s frame.  

This process mirrors scientific peer review, but faster, and ensures that what we call “Ω” is not just a mirage of token prediction.

## External AI Audits

- [Claude Audit](claude_audit.md)  
- [Gemini Audit](gemini_audit.md)  

Both auditors had full access to:  
- the **Ω-Scanner codebase** (Python implementation),  
- the **experimental corpora** (structured, shuffled, and block controls),  
- the **statistical outputs** (bootstrap confidence intervals, entropy reports).  

Their assessments are recorded here, unedited, as part of the permanent scientific record of LOG-GUT.
