## How to Cite This Work

If you use the Omega Scanner in your research, please cite appropriately based on how you used it:

### Primary Citation (Methodology)

For the core Omega Scanner methodology and theoretical framework:

```bibtex
@software{omega_scanner_2025,
  author = {Szyndler, Remy and {Council of Four, AI Systems}},
  title = {Omega Scanner: Information-Theoretic Detection of Long-Range Structure},
  year = {2025},
  url = {https://github.com/oldwalls/omega},
  note = {Collaborative development with GPT-5, Claude Sonnet, and Gemini}
}
```

### Specific Components

If using particular algorithmic components:

**Information Bottleneck Clustering:**
```bibtex
@software{omega_ib_labeler_2025,
  author = {Szyndler, Remy and {Council of Four, AI Systems}},
  title = {Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering for Context Distributions},
  year = {2025},
  howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/oldwalls/omega/blob/main/synthetic/algorithms/code/alphametrics.py}}
}
```

**Conditional Coding Framework:**
```bibtex
@software{omega_cond_coder_2025,
  author = {Szyndler, Remy and {Council of Four, AI Systems}},
  title = {Label-Gated N-gram Models for Compression Analysis},
  year = {2025},
  howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/oldwalls/omega/blob/main/algorithms/code/cond_coder.py}}
}
```

### Results and Findings

If reporting results from using the scanner:

```bibtex
@misc{omega_synthetic_results_2025,
  author = {Szyndler, Remy {Council of Four, AI systems}},
  title = {Omega-Positive Signatures in Synthetic Structured Sequences},
  year = {2025},
  howpublished = {GitHub repository},
  url = {https://github.com/oldwalls/omega/tree/main/synthetic}
}
```

### Academic Paper Format

If citing in running text:

> "We employed the Omega Scanner methodology (Szyndler & Council of Four, 2025) to detect long-range informational structure in our dataset..."

> "Following the conditional coding framework described in the Omega Scanner documentation (Szyndler, 2025), we measured ΔI_pred as..."

### Acknowledging Replication or Extension

If you replicated our results:

> "We successfully replicated the Ω-positive signatures reported by Szyndler & Council of Four (2025) using [dataset/parameters]..."

If you extended the methodology:

> "Building on the Omega Scanner framework (Szyndler & Council of Four, 2025), we developed [your extension]..."

If you found different results:

> "Contrary to findings in Szyndler & Council of Four (2025), our analysis of [dataset] showed [your finding]..."

### Attribution Guidelines

**Required Attribution:**
- When using the scanner methodology
- When using provided datasets
- When building on the theoretical framework
- When reporting replication results

**Recommended Attribution:**
- When inspired by the approach but using different implementation
- When comparing to Omega Scanner results
- When citing negative or contradictory findings

**Not Required (but appreciated):**
- Casual mentions in blog posts or informal write-ups
- Internal research notes or pilot studies
- Teaching materials or tutorials

### Collaborative Nature

This project represents collaboration between human intuition (Remy Szyndler) and AI systems (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet, Gemini). When citing:

- **For scientific papers**: Use the formal citation formats above
- **For technical documentation**: Acknowledge the collaborative development process
- **For critical analysis**: Evaluate the methodology on its technical merits regardless of authorship

### Questions About Citation?

- Open an issue if uncertain about proper attribution
- Email for permission regarding non-standard uses
- See LICENSE file for legal requirements

### Changes to Citation

This is version 1.0 of citation guidelines. If the project evolves significantly:
- A formal preprint or paper may supersede these software citations
- Versioned releases will have specific DOIs for precise citation
- Major methodological changes will warrant separate citations
